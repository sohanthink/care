                                <p>Established in 2015, UOB Art Academy (a registered charity) is dedicated to connecting communities and touching hearts through art. With a focus on Chinese ink art, the Academy seeks to make art more accessible to the public, to inspire and nurture artistic minds and create learning opportunities for less privileged individuals. As a long-standing consultant to the UOB Art Academy, CdD worked closely to conceive of the UOB Art in Ink Awards, now in its eighth year, recently expanding its presence into an Art in Ink Festival jointly presented by the Hong Kong Palace Museum. We also support UOB in identifying and commissioning artists for Art Central in Hong Kong, a partnership we helped to secure. </p>

                                <p>FENIX, a major new museum inspired by stories of global migration, will open on a landmark site in Rotterdam’s City Harbour in 2025. The 16,000 sqm building, dating from 1923, was once part of the largest warehouse in the world. The warehouse served as an important building for storage and shipping for the Holland-America Line, which facilitated the journeys of millions of migrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. The building is being transformed in a radical design by Ma Yansong of MAD Architects, through an architectural masterpiece, the Tornado, an organic, dynamic structure evocative of rising air that climbs from the ground floor and flows up and out of the rooftop onto a platform hovering above the city – an uplifting symbol for the journeys experienced by migrants globally. CdD is supporting the global launch campaign for FENIX. </p>
